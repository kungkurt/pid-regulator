## Integral
while i have implemented a clamp restriction for integral windup, it has its limits.<br />
and also the how much is added for each invocation may be diffrent on diffrent constructions.<br />
<br />
#### integral windup
with integral windup the clamp limits are defined in <integral.h> with the macros<br />
  - CLAMP_LOW_LIMIT
  - CLAMP_HIGH_LIMIT
