## Generating Testbench

when compiling the testbench it will take a long time to run the generated executable file<br />
this is because i need the result after each invocation to calculate made up sensor and actuator value<br />
so it will just que one invocation at time and run.
<br />
i can at least run testbench on x86 with expected results and fast run.<br />
but since i need results to calculte new sensor value for next iteration makes me kinda stuck.<br />
there is probably a great fix for this, but im running out of time.<br />
