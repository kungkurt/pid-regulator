## Process value

in a pid-controller there are an actuator that is known as a plant in control theory and then a sensor that is directly affected by the actuator.<br />
with both the plant and sensor you can create a closed loop system, but in this case we dont know what plant or sensor to use.<br />
we are missing actual hardware.<br />
<br />
the simplest form for simulation is in place, but nothing more than that.
